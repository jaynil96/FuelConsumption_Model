# FuelConsumption_Model
About
  This is a K-Fold Cross Evaluation Regression Model, that attempts to examine the relationship between Engine Consumption Data SetSize and the CO2 Emissions for the Fuel 
  This is an extention to the Single linear Regression Model Possed by the Machine Learning with Python course from edx
  K Fold Cross Evaluation Model is a way to attempt to train the data, by splitting it up into multiple folds, using one fold to train the data, and using the rest to train the model
Features
  Using Scilearn to build a regression model
  Using Scilearns, KFold package to handle the k fold evaluation
  Printing out the R2 score to help understand the accuray of the model
  Plot to find the relation, and visualize data
Future Additions
  Build Multi variable regression model for the data, taking into account some of the other variables
  Examining if the linear model or a non-linear model would be a better fit for the data
