# FuelConsumption_Model
<h2>About</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a K-Fold Cross Evaluation Regression Model, that attempts to examine the relationship between Engine Consumption Data SetSize   and the CO2 Emissions for the Fuel </li>
<li>This is an extention to the Single linear Regression Model Possed by the Machine Learning with Python course from edx</li>
<li>K Fold Cross Evaluation Model is a way to attempt to train the data, by splitting it up into multiple folds, using one fold to train the data, and using the rest to train the model</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using Scilearn to build a regression model
	<li>Using Scilearns, KFold package to handle the k fold evaluation</li>
	<li>Printing out the R2 score to help understand the accuray of the model</li>
	<li>Plot to find the relation, and visualize data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build Multi variable regression model for the data, taking into account some of the other variables</li>
	<li>Examining if the linear model or a non-linear model would be a better fit for the data</li>
</ul>
